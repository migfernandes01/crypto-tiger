## A crypto tracker


### Description:
Crypto Tiger is a platform where the users can view and search for cryptocurrencies. Along with being provided with the most updated information, a user can login using it's e-mail or Google account and add cryptocurrencies to their watchlist.

### Used Technologies:
- [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- React
- Material UI
- Chart.js
- Google Firebase 9

### Goals of this project:
Crypto Tiger was the first big web app I built with React and I really enjoyed the process. My goal with it was to apply all the React concepts I have been learning for the last months and integrate it with Google Firebase to create a useful platform with a great user interface and experience. I have learned a lot during the development proccess and I am ready to learn more about React and develop new and more advanced web applications.
